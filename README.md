CMPT 413 Final Project - Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

Instructions for TA/Prof:

(Note the motivation was to improve upon the results from the 2011 paper http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf
by focusing on using a more effective vectorization method. Also, I am aware there are more advanced ML models that could have been used such as
Neural Nets, however due to the data hungry nature of NN models and the small dataset we are using, I chose to experiment with different classifiers.)

- Open project.ipynb
- Note that all results have already been generated in the notebook and re-running it to get the results again will take a very long time
